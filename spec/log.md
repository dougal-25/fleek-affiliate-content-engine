# Spec — Log

Dated record of design intent changing. Newest first. Decisions with reasoning get their own page in
`spec/decisions/`; this is the running thread.

## 2026-07-09 — Repo restructured around mission / wiki / spec / code

**Why:** the repo had grown by accretion. Things got built, then a home was found for them. Three concrete
failures: the JD and task brief — the two documents this project is judged against — existed nowhere as
files, only as paraphrase inside two strategy docs. A half-finished vault rename had left git reporting 24
phantom deletions and the research agent pointing at a directory that no longer existed. And `docs/` was
sorting four different genres of document under one numbered sequence.

**What changed:**

- **`mission/` created.** `job-description.md` and `task-brief.md` land as placeholders awaiting the verbatim
  text. `mission.md` states what we build and how we're judged — stamped *awaiting sign-off* until the two
  sources are captured, because right now it's an inference drawn from `deliverables/strategy.md`.
- **The vault is one vault.** `FLEEK BRAIN/` → `Fleek Wiki/`, preserving git history (renames, not
  delete+add). An empty nested Obsidian vault created the night before — which is what breaks the parent's
  graph view — was retired to `_attic/`. `FLEEK BRAIN Index.md`/`Log.md` → `index.md`/`log.md`, and all 21
  notes' wikilinks repointed.
- **Naming settled.** Fleek uses *the Brain* for the whole affiliate content engine, so this repo *is* the
  Brain and no subfolder claims the word. The research vault is *the wiki*. Documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
  The `brain_refresh` job is now `wiki_refresh`.
- **`docs/` dissolved by genre.** Architecture, playbook and autonomy design → `spec/`. Strategy and the
  case-study approach → `deliverables/`. The two "what changed since draft 1" tables → `spec/decisions/`,
  where a decision record belongs.
- **The research agent is invocable.** `agents/brain_research_agent.md` → `.claude/agents/wiki-researcher.md`
  with frontmatter. It had been pointing at `FLEEK BRAIN/` and at `scripts/run_brain_research.py`, a script
  that does not exist — that claim is gone; the agent runs as a subagent.
- **`CLAUDE.md` and `spec/overview.md` written.** Neither existed.

**What deliberately did not change:** `content_brain/`, `scripts/` and `run_campaign.py` stay exactly where
they are. Wrapping working code in an `engine/` folder would look tidier and cost a round of Python import
breakage for zero functional gain. The code was never the mess.

**Open:** `mission/job-description.md` and `mission/task-brief.md` are empty. Until Doug pastes the verbatim
text, everything citing the mission is citing an inference.
